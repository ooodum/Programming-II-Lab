Coughing On People Simulator (COPS)

Coughing On People Simulator is a battle royale game where you and a bunch of other people have a very mild condition of an airborne disease by the name of KOVID. You and everyone else are a lab rat, placed inside a test environment to research more about KOVID. In order to survive, your job is to cough on others to make them more sick until they inevitably die, whilst trying to avoid dying to the disease yourself. 

Being in close proximity with an enemy will slowly raise your sickness level. You'll have to social distance to avoid this, but that's now how you win! You can raise others' sickness level by coughing on them. Once your sickness level reaches 100%, you have 10 seconds to use/find a cure to reduce their sickness level or else they will die. You can also die within these 10 seconds if someone coughs on you. During these 10 seconds, however, you have a much higher chance of infecting others.

If you are the last one standing, the scientists will set you free now that they have all the research they need to create a better cure.
